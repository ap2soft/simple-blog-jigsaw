description: How to create a new blog post
---

First of all you need a GitHub account.

Then open your blog repository, find folder `source/_posts` and create a new file inside of it. 
The name of the file should be something like this `my-brand-new-blog-post.md` (lowercase, dash-separated, extention `.md`)

After you're done with editing the file - save it. In a couple of minutes your brand new blog post would be deployed automatically!
